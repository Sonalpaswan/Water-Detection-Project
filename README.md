# 💧 Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether water is **safe or unsafe** for drinking using **Machine Learning, Python, Flask, and a clean UI dashboard**.  
It takes important water parameters (pH, Hardness, Turbidity, Conductivity, etc.) and predicts drinkability with a trained ML model.
